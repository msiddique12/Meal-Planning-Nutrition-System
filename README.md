# Healthy Recipes & Meal Planning System

This repository contains the **SQL database design** for the Healthy Recipes & Meal Planning System, a tool aimed at individuals focused on diet and nutrition management. The database is designed to support:

- Storing user-specific dietary requirements (calorie limits, macronutrient preferences, restrictions).
- Managing cuisine preferences (e.g., Italian, Indian, Mediterranean).
- Generating meal plans for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
- Tracking nutritional breakdowns and estimated meal costs.

## Project Status

Currently, this repository **only includes the SQL schema** for the database design. Future updates will cover the full meal planning functionality and other features.

## Contents

- SQL schema for the database tables
- Populated tables with 10+ tuples each
- Relationship tables between entities like users, meals, dietary restrictions, and cuisines

## Getting Started
